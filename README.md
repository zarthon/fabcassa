Day 1
=====

* Fixed on creating an database schema in cassandra first and than move ahead on hadoop
* Looked on mainly 2 of the high level clients available for cassandra i.e Pycassa for python and pelops for Java.
* Found Pycassa documentation much richer than that of pelops so decided to go ahead creating the application in python.
* before creating the schema in python, will first describe the same in MySql schema but will not populate the tables
